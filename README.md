1) Machine learning:
        Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that allows software applications to become more accurate at predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values.
2) Differences between supervised and unsupervised learning:
        * In supervised learning, we teach or learn data which is well labelled. To learn a mapping from input to output. It can be divided into classification and regression.
               Types of algorithms : (i) regression , (ii) logistic regression (iii) decision tree
        * In unsupervised learning, it can use unlabelled data and it should act without guidance. In other words, it should find patterns in data. It can de divided into clustering and association.
               Types of algorithms : (i) K-means (ii) Apriori algorithm               
3) Test and validation set:
         The “validation dataset” is predominately used to describe the evaluation of models when tuning hyperparameters and data preparation, and the “test dataset” is predominately used to describe the evaluation of a final tuned model when comparing it to other final models.
4) Main preprocessing steps:
        i. Acquire the dataset
        ii. Import all the crucial libraries
        iii. Import the dataset
        iv. Identifying and handling the missing values
        v. Encoding the categorical data
        vi. Splitting the dataset
        vii. Featuture scaling
5) Continous and discrete variable :    
  * Continous : It can assume any value within a specified relevant interval of values assumed by the variable
            eg : The weight of newborn babies
                 The daily wind speed
                 The temperature of a freezer
  * Discrete : It is characterized by gaps or intereptions in the values that it can assume.
           eg : The number of customers who bought different items
                The number of computers in each department
                The number of items you buy at the grocery store each week
